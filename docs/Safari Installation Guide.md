# Safari Installation Guide

Welcome! This guide will walk you through installing the **"Again, Why Salesforce"** Safari extension on macOS.\
Because this app is not distributed through the Mac App Store, there are a few extra steps to enable it — especially for Safari.\
Don't worry! Follow the instructions below and you'll be up and running in just a few minutes.

## Download the Installer

Open [the releases page](https://github.com/Astisme/again-why-salesforce/releases) and find the latest release for Safari.
The release name follows this pattern: `awsf-safari-v?.?.?.dmg` (you'll find numbers instead of the "?").

## Open the Installer

Once downloaded, double-click the `.dmg` file to open it.

### 🛑 If macOS Prevents the App from Opening

When you try to open the app, macOS may show a warning like:

> "Again, Why Salesforce" can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.

You have two options to bypass this:

#### ✅ Option 1: Use Control-Click to Open

1. Go to your **Applications** folder.
2. **Control-click** (or **Right-click**) on **"Again, Why Salesforce"**.
3. Select **Open** from the context menu.
4. A warning dialog will appear, but this time you'll see an **Open** button. Click it.

> 💡 You only need to do this once — after that, macOS will allow the app to open normally.
> ❗ This operation will have to be repeated for future releases.

---

#### 🛠 Option 2: Use System Settings

If the above method doesn’t work, follow these steps:

1. Open **System Settings** (or **System Preferences** on older macOS).
2. Go to **Privacy & Security**.
3. Scroll down to the **Security** section.
4. You’ll see a message about the blocked app — click **"Open Anyway"**.
5. Confirm in the pop-up by clicking **Open**.

> 💡 Again, this only needs to be done once.
> ❗ This operation will have to be repeated for future releases.
