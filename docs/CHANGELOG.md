# v1.4.8

This release re-adds the `lightning.force.com` pattern for Setup pages. This is needed due to production orgs not yet using the `my.salesforce-setup.com` pattern.

For this version, you may still import Tabs using `tabTitle` and `url` (and `org`); however, from version 1.5.0, you'll have to import Tabs using `label` and `url` (and `org`). All versions of the extension until verion 1.5.0 will automatically redownload the imported list of Tabs with `label` instead of `tabTitle`. We thank you for your understanding.

# v1.4.7

This release presents a new screen used in the popup that is used to request permanent access to Salesforce Setup pages. This is needed due to the last release using only `activeTab`.

For this version, you may still import Tabs using `tabTitle` and `url` (and `org`); however, from version 1.5.0, you'll have to import Tabs using `label` and `url` (and `org`). All versions of the extension until verion 1.5.0 will automatically redownload the imported list of Tabs with `label` instead of `tabTitle`. We thank you for your understanding.

# v1.4.6

This release contains a fix to Chrome's export feature and the removal of the tabs permission (only using `activeTab` now).

For this version, you may still import Tabs using `tabTitle` and `url` (and `org`); however, from version 1.5.0, you'll have to import Tabs using `label` and `url` (and `org`).

# v1.4.5

This release contains various improvements such as allowing for org-specific Tabs and it also fixes some bugs from the previous version.

# v1.4.3
