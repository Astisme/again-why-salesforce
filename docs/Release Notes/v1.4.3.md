# [v1.4.3] Release Notes

This release contains fixes to bugs found in the previous version

## Bugs squashed

### Salesforce

1. Fixed bug when trying to open a link in another Org: when the link is not a Salesforce Setup page, `/setup/lightning/` was added anyways;
2. Fixed bug about context menu items not being reloaded when the browser was closed and reopened.
