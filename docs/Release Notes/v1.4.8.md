# [v1.4.8] Release Notes

This release re-adds the `lightning.force.com` pattern for Setup pages. This is needed due to production orgs not yet using the `my.salesforce-setup.com` pattern.

For this version, you may still import Tabs using `tabTitle` and `url` (and `org`); however, from version 1.5.0, you'll have to import Tabs using `label` and `url` (and `org`). All versions of the extension until verion 1.5.0 will automatically redownload the imported list of Tabs with `label` instead of `tabTitle`. We thank you for your understanding.
