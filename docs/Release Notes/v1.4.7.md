# [v1.4.7] Release Notes

This release presents a new screen used in the popup that is used to request permanent access to Salesforce Setup pages. This is needed due to the last release using only `activeTab`.

For this version, you may still import Tabs using `tabTitle` and `url` (and `org`); however, from version 1.5.0, you'll have to import Tabs using `label` and `url` (and `org`). All versions of the extension until verion 1.5.0 will automatically redownload the imported list of Tabs with `label` instead of `tabTitle`. We thank you for your understanding.
