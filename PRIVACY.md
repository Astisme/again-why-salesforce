# Privacy Policy for Why Salesforce Extension

**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

Why Salesforce is a browser extension that adds custom navigation tabs to Salesforce Setup pages. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal data.**

The Why Salesforce extension:
- Does NOT collect personal information
- Does NOT track your browsing activity
- Does NOT send any data to external servers
- Does NOT use analytics or telemetry
- Does NOT access your Salesforce data or credentials

## Data Storage

The extension stores only your custom tab configurations (tab names, URLs, and display preferences) locally in your browser's built-in storage system. This data:
- Is stored entirely on your device
- Syncs only through your browser's native sync feature (if enabled)
- Is never transmitted to us or any third party
- Can be exported and deleted at any time through the extension

## Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions:

- **Storage:** To save your custom tab configurations locally in your browser
- **Host Permissions (Salesforce domains):** To inject the custom navigation tabs into Salesforce Setup pages

These permissions are used solely to provide the extension's functionality.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does not integrate with or send data to any third-party services.

## Data Export and Deletion

You can export your tab configurations at any time using the Export feature. To delete your data, you can:
1. Remove individual tabs through the extension popup
2. Uninstall the extension (this removes all stored data)
3. Clear your browser's extension storage
