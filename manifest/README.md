This directory contains every file related to the manifest, but not the manifest.json itself.

To create it, run `npm run dev-(firefox|chrome|safari)` be sure to pick the browser you'll be using.
You can even use `deno run dev-(firefox|chrome|safari)` to run with Deno.

For example, if you want to use this extension on firefox, run `npm run dev-firefox`.
