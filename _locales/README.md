# Locale translations
These folders follow the [standard structure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Internationalization#anatomy_of_an_internationalized_extension) for extension localization.
At the moment, all translations are powered by AI. Feel free to update a translation you do not like or wish to improve.
When doing so, please create a README.md file in the locale folder you made your change to describe what you changed. This will help you getting known online :)
